# Dotsies Interactive Tutorial

If you haven't heard of dotsies, swing by [The Official Website](http://dotsies.org).

This utility is designed to make you faster at reading dotsies after having completed the intro tutorial on the official website homepage.

I'm a fan of interactive tutorials and intelligent memorization utilities (generates output based on input errors). I find it easier to learn this way. If you do as well, this is for you!

Have fun!
